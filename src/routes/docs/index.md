Welcome to the Fluent Svelte documentation! This page will explain the basic concepts and usage of the library.

### What is this?

`fluent-svelte` is a [Svelte](http://svelte.dev/) component UI library that emulates the look and feel of [Microsoft's Windows UI Controls](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/) which conform to the Fluent Design System.

<InfoBar
    severity="caution"
    title="Before We Begin"
    message="This is not a 1-to-1 re-implementation of WinUI, but rather a faithful attempt to emulate the look and feel of WinUI on the web. Some controls will have API or behaviorial differences, but the overall look and feel should be very similar."
/>

### Features
